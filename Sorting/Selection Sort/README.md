# Selection Sort

The selection sort is a very slow, but intuitive sorting algorithm.

It works by going through every element of an unsorted array and remebers the smallest one.

After having found the smallest element it inserts it into a new list.

This is then repeated.

By always inserting the smallest element into the new list (or into the beginning of the list to be more space efficient) you get a sorted list.

Because having to go through every element for every iteration you get a **time complexity of $ O(n^2) $**
